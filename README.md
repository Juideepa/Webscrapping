# Webscrapping
This project focuses on web scraping job listing data from online job portals to collect information specifically related to company names, job positions, and offered salary packages. Using Python-based web scraping techniques, job listings are extracted from publicly available web pages and converted into a structured dataset. The scraped data is cleaned and organized to ensure accuracy and consistency. The project demonstrates how raw job listing information can be systematically collected and processed using Python for further analysis or reporting. It highlights practical experience in web scraping, data handling, and working with real-world employment data.
